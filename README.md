Gain control of your documents and code: hands-on with revision control and build automation
============================================================================================

Keeping track of your LaTeX documents and source code is difficult.  Your code worked yesterday but today it's mysteriously broken.  How fast can you find the bug?  You want to change a model parameter so you'll need to redraw some graphs.  But which ones?

This seminar gives a live demonstration of tools that can answer these questions.  `git` is a revision control system that remembers every change you made to your files, and lets you synchronise your work across computers in one click.  `make` is a build automation tool: change a line of code and make knows what scripts to run, what graphs to redraw, and which sections of your report to recompile.  

Together, `git` and `make` let you spend less time fighting your computer and more time doing science.
