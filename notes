intro
=====
hands up who's broken code and not known why
hands up who has to collaborate on projects with other people
hands up who gets paranoid that all their graphs are up-to-date when including them in a report

- git: a revision control system
- make: a build automation tool

git
===
concepts
--------
- repository
- commit

demonstration
-------------
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
git init
vi my_report.txt (write a couple of lines of text)
git status
git add my_report.txt
git status
git commit -m "initial revision of my report"
git status
git log
vi my_report.txt (modify a line, add a line, delete a line)
git status
git add my_report.txt
git commit -m "a modification to my report"
git log
git diff --word-diff (copy commit hashes)
TODO: rollback to previous version

distribution with github
------------------------
(with a repo that's already set up)
- commit some stuff
- push
- view on github
- move to different terminal (with different background colour?)
- pull

make
====
concepts
--------
rule
target
prerequisite
commands

demonstration
-------------
a data file with some x-y data
a small python source file that creates a scatter plot of the data (as a pdf)
a LaTeX document that includes the graph
